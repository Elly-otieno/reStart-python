Working with the String Data Type

In Python, a collection of letters and symbols is called a string. 
Strings are used often in Python for input and output.

In this lab, we will:

 - Write Python code that uses the string data type
 - Concatenate strings
 - Use the string to get input
 - Format strings for output

# myString = "This is a string."
# print(myString)

# print(type(myString))

# print(str(myString) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myString)))

 
firstString = "water"
secondString = "fall"

thirdString = firstString + secondString
